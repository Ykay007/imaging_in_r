## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics

- R is the open source implementation of the S language, which was developed by Bell laboratories

- R is both open source and open development

(source: http://www.r-project.org/)

## Why R?

* Powerful and flexible

* Free (open source)

* Extensive add-on software (packages)

* Designed for statistical computing

* High level language

## Why not R?

* Fairly steep learning curve

    * "Programming" oriented
    
    * Minimal interface
    
* Little centralized support, relies on online community and package developers

* Annoying to update

* Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional programming languages (C, Java, Perl, Python)
